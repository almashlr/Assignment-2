# Assignment-2
1. Calculate the mean of the outcome.
2. Use your mean as a prediction: Create a new variable that consists of the
mean of the outcome.
3. Calculate a summary measure of the errors for each observation—the
difference between your prediction and the outcome.
4. Calculate the mean of the outcome at levels of a predictor variable.
5. Use these conditional means as a prediction: for every county, use the
conditional mean to provide a ‘’best guess” as to that county’s level of the
outcome.
6. Calculate a summary measureof the error in your predictions.
